## 🏦 Simple Banking System with Transaction Management (Python Edition)

A command-line banking system developed in **Python** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This project replicates core banking functionalities such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and transaction tracking — inspired by the [React version](https://github.com/JV-Vigneesh/Simple-Banking-System-with-Transaction-Management-React-Edition).
